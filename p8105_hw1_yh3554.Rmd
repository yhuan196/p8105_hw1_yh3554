This is my first data science HW.

#Problem 1

Load the dataset.

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

####Description
The dataset includes the measurement of penguin species that collect from islands of Plamer Archipelago of Antarctica. The variables are species, island, body measurement (bill length in in millimeters , bill depth in millimeters, flipper length in millimeters, body mass in gram), sex, and year. The data has `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` variables. The mean of flipper length is `rround(mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm,na.rm=TRUE), 2)` millimeters.

### Scatterplot

This is scatterplot of flipper length vs bill length.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm, 
           colour = factor(species))) + geom_point()
ggsave("scatterplot of hw1.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```
